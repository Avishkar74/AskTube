[0.08s] Hey guys, welcome back to the channel.
[2.48s] Today we're diving into an insane new AI
[5.20s] tool, Z.AI chat, powered by the GLM 4.6
[9.44s] and GLM 4.5 models. This platform is
[12.72s] absolutely loaded with features. You can
[15.12s] create AI powered slides to instantly
[17.28s] generate professional PPTs, and it even
[19.92s] comes with ready-made templates and HTML
[22.24s] code output.
[24.00s] Next up, the magic design option lets
[26.16s] you create stunning social media banners
[28.32s] and post designs in seconds.
[31.84s] There's also a deep research mode and a
[33.76s] codewriting feature for developers.
[36.64s] And the highlight, you can even build
[38.64s] full stack applications using the full
[40.64s] stack option just like lovable or bolt.
[43.60s] The best part, it's completely free and
[45.84s] open source. I'll select the full stack
[48.88s] option and paste my prompt here. I'm
[51.52s] building an Excel to JSON converter
[53.60s] website with database integration and
[55.60s] authentication. Just hit the submit
[57.68s] button. The GLM 4.6 model is analyzing
[61.52s] our prompt and setting up the project.
[63.76s] You can see it's using Nex.js, Tailwind
[66.24s] CSS, shed CN UI, and Prisma with SQL
[69.52s] light setup as well. Now, it has created
[71.84s] a to-do list and it's executing each
[74.00s] step one by one. The first to-do is
[76.48s] installing the Excel SX library which is
[79.12s] used to read Excel files. See, it
[81.36s] started installing and now it has moved
[83.36s] on to the next task, updating the Prisma
[85.52s] schema. That one's completed, too. Next,
[88.72s] it's moving to the to-do for building
[90.64s] the main page UI design. It's super
[93.12s] fast. Now, only tasks number five and
[95.12s] six are pending. We just need to wait a
[97.04s] few seconds for them to finish. You can
[99.12s] see the website preview appearing now.
[101.04s] And look at that. All the to-dos are
[102.96s] completed. Now, it's checking for any
[105.04s] ESLint issues. So, let's wait a few
[107.04s] seconds again. And done. The website is
[109.52s] now fully completed. It has created a
[112.00s] file upload interface, file conversion
[114.32s] functionality, and several other useful
[116.40s] features as well. You can see it's
[119.04s] running on NextJS15 with TypeScript. For
[122.24s] now, it's using SQLite by default, but
[124.72s] we can switch to Superbase later if
[126.64s] needed. This is the folder structure it
[128.96s] generated. Before checking out the
[130.56s] website, let's take a look at the code.
[132.48s] Click on the code preview toggle button.
[135.28s] Here's the SQL database setup. Prisma
[137.84s] with an example schema and the Nex.js
[140.08s] app router code all neatly organized.
[142.80s] The folder structure is completely
[144.40s] professional. And finally, there's the
[146.32s] shad CN components JSON file. The best
[149.76s] part, you can download the entire
[152.16s] project source code. That's awesome. You
[154.48s] can even modify it as you like and
[156.16s] deploy it anywhere. Now we can check the
[158.56s] website. We're able to open it in a new
[160.72s] tab easily and see everything clearly.
[163.76s] Let's test it. I'll upload a sample
[165.60s] Excel file here and click submit. It
[168.00s] instantly generates the JSON output. You
[170.32s] can see the response. It successfully
[172.32s] converted my Excel data into JSON format
[174.88s] and everything looks perfect. Awesome.
[177.28s] That's exactly what we needed. There's
[179.52s] also an option to download the JSON
[181.52s] file. Let's click and check. Nice. It's
[183.68s] working perfectly. Now, if we go to the
[185.92s] history tab, we can see the converted
[188.16s] file history being stored. Currently,
[190.56s] it's using the SQL light database for
[192.48s] this. Before switching to superbase, I
[194.96s] want to improve the UI design to make it
[196.96s] look even better. So for that, I'll open
[199.20s] the tweak CN website. Using this, we can
[202.08s] easily customize beautiful shed CN
[204.32s] themes.
[206.00s] Click the start button. Here you can see
[208.32s] all the available themes. Let's switch
[210.48s] through them one by one to check which
[212.16s] one suits our design best. There are a
[214.48s] lot of great options, but I'll go with
[216.24s] the last one. I really like this one.
[217.84s] It's called Violet Bloom. Now click the
[220.48s] code option. You'll see two ways to
[222.72s] apply the theme. Either install it using
[224.72s] PNPM or simply copy and paste the CSS
[227.60s] code. I'll just copy the CSS code here.
[231.04s] Now I'm going to the GLM chat, pasting
[233.60s] the CSS code there, and hitting submit.
[236.40s] The agent will automatically update our
[238.40s] theme. It usually takes around 30 to 40
[241.12s] seconds. And done. The theme has been
[243.60s] changed. Everything looks so much better
[245.76s] compared to the previous version. It
[247.60s] even includes a dark mode exactly like
[249.76s] the one we copied. looks clean and
[251.92s] professional now. Now we'll integrate
[254.96s] Superbase into our project. For that,
[257.12s] open Superbase and create a new project
[259.20s] for the website. Once it's created,
[261.36s] click the connect button, then go to the
[263.76s] app framework tab. Since we're using the
[266.16s] NextJS app router, copy the environment
[268.72s] keys provided there. Next, go back to
[271.04s] the agent, paste those environment keys,
[273.36s] and also share the Next.js Superbase
[275.52s] docs URL with it. This helps the agent
[277.76s] understand and set up Superbase
[279.28s] correctly. Then just type integrate
[281.44s] Superbase and hit submit. The agent will
[283.84s] start working on it.
[286.24s] It creates a new to-do list again and
[288.32s] the first task is installing the
[289.92s] necessary Superbase packages. Nice.
[292.48s] We'll wait about a minute for that to
[293.92s] complete.
[295.52s] Now the agent has finished the setup,
[297.52s] but there's one more step we need to do
[299.28s] manually. The agent mentions that we
[301.28s] need to open the Superbase dashboard, go
[303.60s] to the SQL editor, and paste the
[305.52s] provided SQL queries. So I'll copy those
[307.84s] SQL queries now and open the SQL editor
[310.16s] in Superbase.
[312.32s] Here I'll paste the SQL queries and
[314.48s] click the run button. This will generate
[316.48s] our table inside Superbase. And there it
[319.04s] is. We got the success message. Now open
[321.60s] the tables menu. You can see our
[323.68s] conversion history table has been
[325.12s] created. Awesome. Superbase is now fully
[327.92s] connected to our app. Next, I'll upload
[330.88s] a sample Excel file here and click
[333.04s] submit. It's generating the JSON output
[335.44s] perfectly. Now if you go to the history
[337.68s] tab, you'll notice the data is being
[339.92s] saved, but this time it's stored in the
[342.00s] superbase table, not in SQL light. After
[344.96s] refreshing, the data appears instantly.
[347.20s] Everything's working flawlessly. You can
[349.12s] even create multiple tables in the same
[350.96s] way if needed.
[352.88s] Now we're going to integrate Superbase
[354.88s] email authentication. Enter the prompt
[357.20s] integrate off and hit submit. The agent
[359.68s] will handle the Superbase integration
[361.36s] automatically. We've received the new
[363.60s] to-do list for this task. The first step
[365.92s] is to install the authentication
[367.60s] package. So let's wait a few seconds for
[369.52s] that to finish.
[371.44s] While it's installing, open Superbase.
[373.52s] Go to authentication providers and
[376.40s] disable the email confirmation. This is
[378.64s] just for development purposes so we
[380.40s] don't get any verification emails. You
[382.56s] can reenable it later in production. Now
[385.20s] the agent is creating the signin and
[387.12s] signup pages. Once that's done, our app
[389.92s] now requires a login to access it. But
[392.56s] before logging in, we need to run a few
[394.48s] SQL queries in Superbase. The GLM agent
[397.28s] has already provided the SQL query. So,
[399.44s] copy it and open the SQL editor in
[401.60s] Superbase.
[403.44s] Here, I'll paste the queries and hit the
[405.44s] run button.
[409.68s] You'll see an error because the history
[411.36s] table already exists. So, go ahead and
[413.52s] delete the previous table. Then, run the
[415.68s] query again. This time, it works
[417.60s] successfully. You'll notice something
[419.76s] new. The updated history table now
[421.84s] includes a user ID column. That means
[424.32s] every conversion history record will be
[426.24s] linked to the loggedin user. Now open
[428.88s] the website and try signing up.
[432.48s] Enter your username, email address, and
[434.72s] password. Then click sign up. The user
[437.52s] is created instantly. Next, log in with
[440.24s] the same email and password. Click sign
[442.48s] in and it works perfectly.
[444.40s] Authentication is fully functional. Now
[446.88s] to confirm, open the Superbase
[448.80s] dashboard. users table. You'll see the
[451.44s] newly created user record there. Our
[453.92s] website is now fully integrated with
[455.68s] Superbase authentication. Everything's
[457.84s] connected and working smoothly.
